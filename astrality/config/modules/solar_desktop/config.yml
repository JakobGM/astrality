module/solar_desktop:
    # A module for changing your wallpaper based on the suns position in the
    # sky, while changing the font color of two conky modules to fit the
    # wallpaper's colors. This module demonstrates more advanced features.
    #
    # I reccomend you to read the docs at https://astrality.readthedocs.io
    # if you want to understand something that seems unclear.
